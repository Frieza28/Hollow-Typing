# Hollow-Typing

Celeste meets Epistory! In our 2D game we try to merge mechanics from each game to make a unique platform-typing experience. In Hollow Typing the player must type words fast and (in some cases) in real time to advance through the level by solving puzzles, defeating enemies, and become victorious. The levels will follow a similar structure as Celeste in 2D while using typing mechanic from Epistory.
